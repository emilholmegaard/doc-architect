## Context

The architecture team has recognized the need for a consistent and transparent method for documenting architectural decisions. This decision aims to adopt the Architecture Decision Record (ADR) process as a standard practice within the team.

## Decision

## Consequences

Adopting the ADR process will provide a clear and consistent method for documenting architectural decisions, making it easier for team members to understand the rationale behind decisions and for new members to onboard. It may require an initial investment of time to document past decisions and train the team on the new process, but it is expected to pay off in the long term through improved communication and documentation quality.
